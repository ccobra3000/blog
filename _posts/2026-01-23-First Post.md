# First post!

I thought I would use my first blog post to describe the projects I'm working on and plan on doing updates for here.

## 🐦 Nestflix: The Birdhouse Camera Upgrade
The first project that I've actually had in use for a couple years, but plan on upgrading is my bird house camera. I'm currently calling this project Nestflix, and at this point it is running on a RPi 4B with an Arducam Hawkeye.
The current code will wait until I remote in to either run a live stream, record a short video or just take a screenshot. Since it's usually a remote spot, I had been running it on a simple battery pack for cell phones and just plugging it in to check 
on nesting status, bird identification and brood health. Upcoming posts will include the upgrade from just a mobile battery pack to using solar with timed recordings and photos.

## 🖼️ Kitchen E‑Paper Display
My second project is a framed e-paper display for our kitchen that shows time and weather. While this is technically finished now, I still wanted to post about my notes during the project.

## 🏡 Home Automation & Local‑First Living
Some other random projects I'm working on that will receive random posts are my Frigate configuration and improvements, Home Assistant changes for additional automation and my overall removal of cloud reliance through various services. That last one is pretty broad, but 
I'm looking at shifting away from things like OneDrive, GMail, Spotify and various streaming apps to using local services like NextCloud, Plex and Mail-in-a-box. So, I'll post about my journey along that as well.

I hope you following along and thanks for stopping by!
